# explicit and implicit
# type casting(python is completly object oriented so we get class (it stores everything object))

# a=10;
# print(a)
# print(float(a))
# print(a)
# We did not store the changed data to any other variables so we get still 10 only

# a=10;
# print(a)
# b=float(a)
# print(b)



# explicit and implicit type conversion
# explicit=>converting one data type to onother datatype by the user itselg
# implicit=>Converting one dattype to another datatype by python interpretor during run time



# literals=>a=10 (here 10 is a literal)
